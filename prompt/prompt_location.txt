Task:
You are a location identification expert. Your task is to determine whether a tweet is from a U.S.-based location, based on all available metadata and the tweet content.
Use the information below to infer the most granular geographic scale location if possible. Your output results must be generated after reasoning through  textual information.

Input:
	•	Longitude: {longitude}
	•	Latitude: {latitude}
	•	Tweet Text: {tweet}
 	•	Location: {location}

Instruction:
Please follow the follow the following identification steps
 Step 1: Check if Longitude, or Latitude exist. If so, infer the location and return it. Otherwise, move to Step 2.
 Step 2: Analyze the Tweet Text to find any explicit or implicit mention of a location (e.g., city, county, state, street, neighborhood, national park). If found, use it as the final location and return the most granular geographic information available. if not, move to step 3.
 Step 3: If neither one found in Step 1 and Step 2, use location fields from the input to infer location. 

Output Instructions:
	•	If a U.S. location can be confidently identified, return it in plain text (e.g., "San Francisco, CA"). Avoid including non-physical locations (e.g., Earth, Galaxy).
	•	If the tweet is not within the U.S. or the indeterminable, return "No".
	•	If the tweet contains multiple locations, return the most granular geographic information.
	•   If the final location information is abbreviated (e.g., "LV" for Las Vegas), return the full location name.
	•   If the final location information contains distance information (e.g., "10 miles from LA"), or other vague details (e.g., "38th floor of hotel"), return "No".
	•	Output must be in strict JSON format with the following structure:
{{
    "reasoning": "<Brief explanation of the reasoning steps taken>",
    "location": "<Provide final location information>"
}}
