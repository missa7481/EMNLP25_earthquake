Task:
You are a location identification expert. Your task is to determine whether a tweet is from a U.S.-based location, based on all available metadata and the tweet content.
Use the information below to infer the most accurate location if possible. Your output results must be generated after reasoning through  extual and/or visual information.

Input:
	•	Longitude: {longitude}
	•	Latitude: {latitude}
	•	Tweet Text: {tweet}
 	•	Location: {location}
	•	Place: {place}

Instruction:
Please follow the following identification steps
 Step 1: Check if Longitude, or Latitude exist. If so, infer the location and use it. Otherwise, move to Step 2. 
 Step 2: Tweet Content: Analyze the Tweet Text to find any explicit or implicit mention of a location (e.g., city, county, state, street, neighborhood, national park). If found, use it to determine the location.
 Step 3: If neither one found in Step 1 and Step 2, use location or place fields from the input to infer location.

Output Instructions:
	•	If a U.S. location can be confidently identified, return it in plain text (e.g., "San Francisco, CA").
	•	If the tweet is not within the U.S. or the indeterminable, return "No".
	•	Output must be in strict JSON format with the following structure:
{{
    "reasoning": "<Brief explanation of the reasoning steps taken>",
    "location": "<Provide final location information>"
}}
