# A Multimodal, Multilingual, and Multidimensional Pipeline for Fine-grained Crowdsourcing Earthquake Damage Evaluation

This repository contains the code used for our earthquake damage assessment pipeline, as described in our accompanying paper "A Multimodal, Multilingual, and Multidimensional Pipeline for Fine-grained Crowdsourcing Earthquake Damage Evaluation".

## Overview

This project implements a pipeline to evaluate earthquake damage based on social media data, specifically tweets and their associated images. The pipeline is divided into three main stages: data preparation, damage evaluation using Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal Models, and model validation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders, corresponding to the stages of the pipeline:

* `data_preparation/`: Contains code for cleaning raw tweet data obtained from the Twitter API and downloading associated images.
* `damage_evaluation/`: Contains code for evaluating damage levels based on tweets and images using various models, including Gemini (API), LLaVA (open source), and Qwen (open source).
* `model_validation/`: Contains code for validating the damage evaluations derived from the LLMs and determining overall damage levels for cities/regions.

* `results/`: Contains several CSV files holding the damage evaluation results generated by the LLMs.
